* anonymous event handlers do cause a rebind on every rerender
* without key: updates element, with key: removes and creates element
* useEffect needs dedicated implementation

* rendering happens from the top down (BigPad does not work because the parent still sees it as BigPad not as its individual buttons)

* the tree of elements represents the "virtual dom"
  ** can be used to demonstrate the "virtual dom"
